    description:
      Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker. <br>
      The codemaker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write,
      creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6. <br>
      The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty). <br>
      In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers. <br>
      The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces. <br>
